        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Alisa's Cat Shelter, we are dedicated to providing loving care and
          finding forever homes for cats in need. Since our founding, we have
          rescued, rehabilitated, and rehomed hundreds of cats, giving them a
          second chance at happiness.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          We provide temporary shelter, medical care, and socialization for
          abandoned, stray, and surrendered cats. Our experienced volunteers
          work tirelessly to ensure each cat receives the attention and care
          they deserve while they wait for their perfect match.

        <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in making thoughtful matches between cats and their new
          families. Our adoption process includes meeting with potential
          adopters, ensuring compatibility, and providing ongoing support to
          help both cats and families adjust to their new life together.

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to support our mission! Whether through
          volunteering, donations, or simply spreading the word about our
          available cats, every contribution makes a difference in the lives of
          these amazing animals.
